# FISH MARKET PREDICTION Project
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on the Linear Regression using the Fish Market Dataset.
The project leverages Gradient Descent to accurately predict fish weights based on various features.

## Data Source
The project utilizes the Fish Market dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle at the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipullrathod/fish-market

## Project Overview
The core of the project is to implement and understand Linear Regression using Gradient Descent.
And trying to implement Gradient Descent from scratch without using libraries like Tensorflow, Keras etc.
The model is trained on the Fish Market dataset to predict fish weights based on various features like length1, length2 length3, height, width... aiming to plot a straight line for each that best fits the data.
The project demonstrates the iterative process of Gradient Descent, which finds the weights and bias that produce the model with the lowest loss.
The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository provides a detailed walkthrough of the model architecture, training loop and evaluation metrics.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation: 
The CSV file is already included in this repository for convenience.
To replicate the project results, it is necessary that the Fish Market dataset from the specified Kaggle URL is present on the same folder as the jupyter notebook.

## Training Results

The following plots illustrate the performance of the linear regression model
